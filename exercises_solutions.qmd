## Walkthrough 1.1: Getting Started

### Setting Up the Python Environment

If you haven't already installed Python, Jupyter, and the necessary packages, there are instructions on the course repo in the README to do so [here](https://github.com/ismayc/oreilly-fundamentals-of-statistics-with-python/blob/main/README.md). 

If you aren't able to do this on your machine, you may want to check out [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It's a free service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.

```{python}
# Importing libraries/modules and aliasing them as needed
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels.api as sm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
```

### Load a dataset

```{python}
# Load in the dataset
spotify_sample = pd.read_csv("spotify_sample.csv")
```

### Perform regression analysis and checks
